# HDSet-DBSCAN
This is the code of the HDSet-DBSCAN matching algorithm proposed in

Jian Hou, Huaqiang Yuan, Marcello Pelillo. Game-Theoretic Hypergraph Matching with Density Enhancement. Pattern Recognition, vol. 133, 2023.

Dependency

You may need to compile the codes in the "ann_mwrapper" and "vlfeat-0.9.19" folders. These two third-party libraries are used in approximate knn and SIFT feature detection.

Tested with Matlab R2010b.

Usage

Simply run demo_hdset_dbscan.m for a demonstration of the matching process.
